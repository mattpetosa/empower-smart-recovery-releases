# Release history

Newest first. Downloads are on the [Releases](https://github.com/mattpetosa/empower-smart-recovery-releases/releases) page.

## v3.10.0.1-1.2.0 (2026-10-07)

### Changed
- **Downloads now need an activated copy.** Syncing files into C:\Client proves this copy's license to the server for each download session, without sending the license key. An unactivated copy is told to activate before any file is tried. App updates are not affected — every copy still updates itself, and the restore scripts built into the app still work offline.

## v3.10.0.1-1.1.7 (2026-10-06)

### Changed
- **One download, no offline ISO.** The Waters restore scripts are now built into the app, and it puts them in C:\Client\DRScripts the first time it opens — so the single "Download App" file works on a server with no internet. A newer script synced from the server is never overwritten. The separate offline ISO is gone.

## v3.10.0.1-1.1.6 (2026-10-06)

### Changed
- **The app tells the license site it's in use.** When an activated copy opens (at most twice a day), it quietly checks in, so the license holder's activations page shows when each computer last used the app and on which version. It sends a one-way fingerprint of the license key — never the key itself — and does nothing if the computer is offline.
- **Check for app updates from the header.** A small round arrow button beside the version opens a window that shows each step as it happens: the license confirmed with the activation server, the check for a newer version, the download (verified before it's kept), and finally **Restart now** / **Later** — or "You have the latest version". After an update the version in the header reads "Updated to v…" in green for that session.
- **Every copy updates, activated or not** — at startup and from the button. The license still unlocks the app's actions and the C:\Client downloads.

## v3.10.0.1-1.1.5 (2026-10-06)

### Fixed
- **Activation reaches the licensing server again, and the "install complete" email is sent again.** Since the app's code was obfuscated (September), its requests to the licensing server failed inside the app before they were sent: activation quietly fell back to offline activation, and the email the license holder gets when an Empower install finishes was never sent. Both work again.

## v3.10.0.1-1.1.4 (2026-10-06)

### Changed
- **Logs go into a folder named for this app:** `C:\Client\Logs\Empower Smart Recovery`, so each Smart Tools app's logs are kept apart. The folder can be read by administrators only (C:\Client is shared on the network). Logs this app wrote straight into `C:\Client\Logs` before are moved there the first time it opens.
